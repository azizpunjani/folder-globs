    "description": "Using exclusion patterns slows down Grunt significantly instead of creating a set of patterns like '**/*.js' and '!**/node_modules/**' this method is used to create a set of inclusive patterns for all subdirectories skipping node_modules, bower_components, dist, and any .dirs This enables users to create any directory structure they desire. This is based off code that cgross wrote in the cg-angular generator,  I abstracted it out so it can be used independently.",
